### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Linxuan(Lucien) Jia

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linxuan Jia, Iâ€™m currently a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania, my current major is [MEAM](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) (Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics) and my concentration is Mechatronic and Robotic Systems. 

ðŸ’« Iâ€™m a creative person, I love design and create things no matter it is a concrete product like a robot or an abstracted concept like an algorithm, which gives me huge sense of accomplishment.

ðŸ“• My research and project interests lie in automation and intelligence for all kinds of mechatronic products and robots, such as self-driving cars, multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arms, mobile robotic platforms and so on. I enjoy designing mechanical structures, electronic circuits, and developing perceptual, planning and control algorithms for such products. At the same time, I'm also learning to develop easier human-computer interactions for these products, including digital twins, hardware-based remote controls, and more user-friendly interfaces.
